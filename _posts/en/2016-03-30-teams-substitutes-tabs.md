title: "New feature! - Simplified management of teams and substitutes "
localization: teams-substitutes-tabs

Some adjustments were made to league pages to simplify the management of players. The “Players” tab was replaced by two new tabs. The “Teams” tab gather all the team management actions as well as actions to manage regular players. The “Substitute” tab allows the management of the substitute bank of the league and each team.
