title: "New feature! - Season management and player notes"
localization: seasons

You can now obtain the ranking of each season played because MaLigue.ca now allows to configue seasons. Also, when you specified seasons, you can choose which season to display in the game calendar. It hides games played during the previous years to only show the relevant games to players.

We also added the possibility of adding notes about each player or substitute that are registred in your league. For example, you can now enter the jersey number of each player. Notes are shared between league managers and captains.
